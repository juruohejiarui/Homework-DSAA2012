\title{Cantonese Lyric Generation with Tone-Aware Alignment}


% The \author macro works with any number of authors. There are two commands
% used to separate the names and addresses of multiple authors: \And and \AND.
%
% Using \And between authors leaves it to LaTeX to determine where to break the
% lines. Using \AND forces a line break at that point. So, if LaTeX puts 3 of 4
% authors names on the first line, and the last on the second line, try using
% \AND instead of \And before the third author name.

\begin{abstract}
Generating singable Cantonese lyrics is challenging due to tonal constraints that affect meaning and rhythm. Existing AI lyric generators often ignore tones, resulting in unnatural pronunciation. This project proposes a \textbf{tone-aware lyric generation system} that rewrites lyrics into Cantonese while preserving melody and emotion. We aim to create a framework and evaluate outputs for tone alignment and singability, demonstrating how AI can assist creative songwriting in tonal languages.

\section{Introduction}
Cantonese lyric adaptation faces a unique challenge --- tonal mismatches between melody and lyrics. Unlike Mandarin, Cantonese has six to nine tones that directly affect the semantic and rhythmic harmony of songs. Current AI lyric generators often ignore tone constraints, leading to unnatural pronunciation when sung. This project aims to develop a \textbf{tone-aware lyric rewriting system} that converts existing lyrics into singable Cantonese versions while preserving rhythm, rhyme, and emotion.

\section{Research Goals}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Build a model capable of generating tone-aligned Cantonese lyrics from existing songs.
    \item Evaluate the quality of tone alignment, fluency, and emotional match.
\end{itemize}

\section{Expected Contributions}
\begin{itemize}
    \item A novel approach for tone-aware lyric generation in tonal languages.
    \item Insights into the impact of tone alignment on lyrical naturalness.
    \item A lightweight system feasible to develop and test within several months on a single GPU.
\end{itemize}

\section{Expected Outcomes}
\begin{itemize}
    \item High tone--melody alignment for Cantonese lyrics.
    \item Preservation of semantic coherence from original songs.
    \item Noticeable improvement in singability and naturalness over existing systems.
\end{itemize}

This work demonstrates how AI can support creative music generation in tonal languages, combining \textbf{academic novelty} with \textbf{practical applications} in songwriting.
