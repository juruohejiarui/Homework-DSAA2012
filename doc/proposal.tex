\title{Multimodal Artificial Intelligence for Doudizhu}


% The \author macro works with any number of authors. There are two commands
% used to separate the names and addresses of multiple authors: \And and \AND.
%
% Using \And between authors leaves it to LaTeX to determine where to break the
% lines. Using \AND forces a line break at that point. So, if LaTeX puts 3 of 4
% authors names on the first line, and the last on the second line, try using
% \AND instead of \And before the third author name.

\begin{abstract}
Doudizhu is a typical poke game with imperfect information. My project aims to build a multimodal artificial intelligence for Doudizhu. The AI will not only take the game state and history action as input, but also the emotional and facial expression of the players by a vision recognition module and a speech recognition module, which also handle the transform of game state (if possible).
\end{abstract}

\section*{Introduction}
Doudizhu represents a complex decision-making environment involving hidden information, bluffing, and emotional interaction among players. Traditional AI approaches for such games focus solely on card state and history, ignoring the social and psychological aspects that influence player behavior. This project explores a multimodal AI that perceives not only the gameplay state but also player expressions and speech.

\section{Research Goals}

The main research goal is to design an AI system capable of integrating multimodal sensory data to enhance strategic reasoning in imperfect-information games.  

\section{Methodology}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Collecting previous Doudizhu game data, including labeled datasets for card recognition, and base datasets of videos and audios of Doudizhu games.
    \item Collecting existed models and frameworks of Doudizhu AI, emotion recognition, facial expression recognition, and speech recognition.
    \item Implementing a baseline Doudizhu AI using reinforcement learning or supervised learning.(Currently I can only find RL frameworks)
    \item Train the prototype model with the collected datasets.
\end{itemize}

\section{Expected Contributions and Outcomes}
Deliver a working prototype demonstrating the feasibility of emotion-aware Doudizhu AI.

\section{Conclusion}
This project seeks to combine game-theoretic reasoning with multimodal learning to build an intelligent Doudizhu agent that interacts and reasons in a more human-like manner. The research outcomes may inspire further exploration of emotion-integrated AI in complex social games.
